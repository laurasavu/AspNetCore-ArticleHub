# üì∞ ArticleHub
Project Overview
üéØ Project Goal
I developed a centralized web platform for managing scientific articles and enabling collaboration among researchers.

üë• Target Audience
The application is intended for research institutions, academic organizations, and companies in the scientific sector that require a robust technological solution for collaborative scientific publication management.

üõ†Ô∏è Problem Addressed / Usefulness
Many research institutions face:

Fragmentation of scientific information across multiple platforms

Lack of a centralized overview of scientific output

Difficulty in collaboration between researchers from different departments

Main Features
‚úÖ Full CRUD System (Create, Read, Update, Delete):

Article listing

Article creation

Article editing

Article deletion

Application Architecture and Technologies Used
Frontend (Client-side):
HTML5 / CSS3: Page structure and visual design

JavaScript ES6: Application logic on the browser level

Fetch API: Asynchronous communication with the server

Backend (Server-side):
ASP.NET Core 6.0: Main framework used for web application development

Entity Framework Core: ORM for accessing the PostgreSQL database

AutoMapper: Automatic mapping between domain entities and DTOs

Basic Authentication: Custom middleware for authentication and security

PostgreSQL: Relational database used for persistent data storage

Conclusion
The application demonstrates the implementation of a modern full-stack architecture, with a clear separation between frontend and backend, using current technologies and web development best practices.

Benefits
Centralization of scientific content on a single platform

Efficient collaboration between researchers across various fields

Tracking of project progress and deadlines

Version control and document revision management

Fast search across the article and study database
